						I chose to pursue this Adult Professional Trainer course
						as it had been a long-standing wish. I decided to embark
						on this adventure at AFPAR, having been a former learner
						and wanting to understand the center's method of
						facilitation and support. With its unique structure,
						including a framework followed by work psychologists
						upstream and ERE follow-up after the PT, being in the
						training pool while being a learner allowed me to build
						solid foundations in training, and for the future, in my
						facilitations.

						This training course had to be paused for personal
						reasons. However, I was able to learn a lot about the
						new techniques that a System Administrator needs to
						know:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Setting up automated procedures for installing
							local, hybrid, and pure Cloud networks
						</li>
						<li>
							Configuring inspection agents for setting up logging
							and backup on a network
						</li>
						<li>
							Simulating and using systems to verify the
							consistency of the setup
						</li>

						This experience was beneficial, and I wish to complete
						it in the near future

					<h4>Software Developer Training</h4>

						<li>Date: 2011</li>
						<li>
							Training Location: SPL AFPAR, Saint-Paul, Reunion

						<li>
							<abbr title="Professional Title">PT</abbr> - RNCPXXX

						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Initial Training. It allowed me to acquire all the
						programming basics that would become my method for
						development. It enabled me to understand four major
						paths in development:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Heavy client development: with Java, it was
							beneficial in the sense that I acquired SOLID bases
							(get the reference?) in programming
						</li>
						<li>
							Development oriented around WEB technologies: HTML
							in its version 4 (version 5 was still in Draft),
							vanilla JS, then with JQUERY (press <kbd>F</kbd> to
							respect), vanilla CSS and bootstrap.
						</li>
						<li>
							PHP: because it had to meet a local market demand,
							then became my language of choice, even today.
							However, at that time, no framework in learning,
							everything was done manually. Why, you might ask?
							Because of the magic word that still crosses my
							mind: <b>Method</b>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Databases: more than using tools and
							<abbr title="Database Management Systems">DBMS</abbr
							>, it was especially about data-oriented design
							methods, with a design tool at its head: Merise
							(which I still use today)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The entirety of this training allowed me to have solid
						reflection and foundations for the rest of my
						professional experience

						As a new Trainer at AFPAR, I joined this organization

						training action allows a public interested in new
						technologies oriented around digital to explore
						technologies in order to form an opinion, to get
						informed, and to orient themselves around a professional
						title. The goal of this action is to be able to
						accompany learners in a path, as well as to gain
						experience in the business world, through an immersion
						period.
